Hello TVS TEam,

I have purchased Vivo Y31 mobile from Sangeetha mobiles (Chilkalguda Branch) on 14 Feb 21 on EMI. since then 3 EMIs were deducted without any issues. but for June month EMI there is a issue am facing.

The issue is i got a text message from TVS on 31 May 21 mentioning  my EMI will be deducted on 07th June 21 and asked me to maintain sufficient balance in my account PFA.

My account had sufficient balance as said but still check bounce amount got deducted from my account on 6th Jun 21 and after deduction of Check bounce amount also we had sufficient balance PFA.

Still we made EMI payment online and we received reference number of receipt of it as well PFA.

My concern is First when there was sufficient balance in my account why the check was bounced. Second when it was intimated to me that my EMI will be deducted on 7th June why the check was bounced on 6th June. Third my mobile is showing TVS Notice as wall paper PFA, how will it remove. how will i get my Check bounce amount refunded.
